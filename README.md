# Initial and final encodings, with and without Backpack

These are a few little projects that I'm using to explore a few different approaches for creating and consuming expressions in situations where you may want to add new ways of creating or consuming the expressions in the future.

It's worth going through these in the following order:

- [final encoding](./final)
- [final encoding with Backpack](./final-bp)
- [initial encoding](./initial)
- [initial encoding with Backpack](./initial-bp)
