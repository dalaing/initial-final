This is a playground of code behing a blog post on initial and final encodings using Backpack.

You probably want to look [here](./blog/posts/backpack-for-initial-and-final-encodings.md) for the post itself.

You need GHC 8.2 and Cabal 2.0 or greater to play around with it, and then
```
cabal new-build all
```
should get things building for you.
